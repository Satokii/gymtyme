# GymTyme

## Description

GymTyme is a workout app created with React which allows a user to create workouts tailored to their own fitness goals. In order to create a workout, the user can pick exercises from a filterable list of suggestions and change the number of sets and reps as required. Alternatively, the details of an exercise can be manually entered and added to the workout.

After the user has finished a workout they can complete it, or delete the workout if it is no longer needed. A list of the completed workouts is available to view in the app.
